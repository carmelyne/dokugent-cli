# Caretags

Caretags are structured log messages that trace meaningful decisions, warnings, or judgments within Dokugent CLI workflows.

They help track agent behavior, enforce trust boundaries, and ensure auditability during simulation, preview, certification, and compilation.

## Caretag Boundaries

ðŸš« **Do not emit caretags from the view layer.**

The view layer (e.g., `paddedLog`, `printTable`, or other UI utilities) is responsible only for formatting or displaying data. It should not emit caretags, as it makes no decisions and holds no judgment.

âœ… Caretags should only be emitted from logic layers that evaluate, validate, or gate agent behavior â€” such as:

- `runTokenTrustCheck`
- `evaluateRefusal`
- `validatePlanTrace`
- `checkSignatureTrust`

Caretags represent *semantic decisions*, not style.
