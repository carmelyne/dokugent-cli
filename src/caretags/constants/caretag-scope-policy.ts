/**
 * LLM Response Log:
 * @respondedBy: ChatGPT-4o
 * @timestamp: 2025-06-24T17:18:00Z
 * @interpretation: The file defines canonical CareTag enforcement levels by directory, allowing tools to determine which files must, may, or must not include CareTags. Includes support for lifecycle completion signaling through status.
 * @clarifications: None needed â€“ mapping is clear and structured.
 * @concerns: Long-term maintainability might require glob support or nested rule handling if file structure expands.
 * @suggestions: Consider exposing this as part of a caretag-policy.json for downstream tools or config UIs. A quick audit tool using this would be valuable.
 * 	@moodResponse: Practical and supportive. Aligning with Pongâ€™s intent to encode doctrine into the codebase and keep human-AI norms traceable.
 * 	@context: This scope policy acts as the ruleset for enforcing the cultural contract of CareTags, deciding where dialogue with AI is expected versus optional.
