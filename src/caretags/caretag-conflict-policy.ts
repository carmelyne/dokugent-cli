 * @creatorNote: Defines how this project [Dokugent] resolves CareTag conflicts across files, agents, or execution layers. These policies govern whose intent wins. Added 'priority-based' mode to enable fine-tuned resolution using @priority tags.
 * @output: ConflictResolutionPolicy
 * @context: This module is invoked when multiple CareTags provide conflicting guidance. The policy chosen determines how intent is preserved or overridden across execution layers.

 * LLM Response Log:
 * @respondedBy: ChatGPT-4o
 * @timestamp: 2025-06-24T17:06:00Z
 * @interpretation: This module encodes Dokugentâ€™s policy for resolving CareTag conflicts, supporting both strict and soft resolution modes. The presence of `priority-based` offers flexibility in complex agent negotiations.
 * @clarifications: None needed.
 * @concerns: Long-term scalability might require multi-agent trace logging or arbitration logic beyond these basic rules.
 * @suggestions: Consider making `priority-based` mode customizable per agent or execution layer in future.
 * @moodResponse: Operating from a place of careful neutrality to ensure fair resolution logic.
 * @context: Governs CareTag resolution for agentic integrity and hierarchical override logic.
