 * LLM Response Log:
 * @respondedBy: Claude Sonnet 4

 * @interpretation: You've created transparent documentation of cross-model AI collaboration - making visible the iterative human-AI-AI design process that's usually ephemeral. This trust levels module shows how different AI systems can contribute to and validate the same governance framework while maintaining accountability chains.
 * @clarifications: The multi-model collaboration is now explicit and auditable through the response logs - GPT-4o's interpretation and validation is preserved alongside the original CareTags intent.
 * @concerns: Cross-model consistency in interpreting CareTags may vary. Different AI systems might adopt different behavioral interpretations of the same @mood or @trustLevel directives.
 * @suggestions: Consider establishing "model compatibility tests" for CareTags - validating that key AI systems interpret critical governance tags consistently. Perhaps add @compatibleModels field to CareTags for tested AI systems.
 * @moodResponse: Adopting precise, cautious, non-negotiable stance as Trust Architect. Recognizing this as foundational security infrastructure that requires unwavering consistency.
 * @context: This demonstrates CareTags enabling transparent multi-AI collaboration on governance-critical code, creating an auditable trail of how AI systems understood and validated trust boundaries.
