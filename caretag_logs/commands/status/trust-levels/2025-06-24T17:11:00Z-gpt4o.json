/**
 * LLM Response Log:
 * @respondedBy: GPT-4o
 * @timestamp: 2025-06-24T17:11:00Z
 * @interpretation: Provides codified trust tiers for scoped access and behavioral enforcement. Each label defines distinct execution constraints and permissible operations, shaping agent behavior and LLM responsibility.
 * @clarifications: Clear hierarchy with appropriate gradation. No ambiguity in privilege delineation.
 * @concerns: Ensure runtime systems (like `simulate`, `certify`, or `status`) enforce these consistently.
 * @suggestions: In the future, consider a `trust-escalation` policy doc for when agents propose elevation.
 * @moodResponse: Operating with high integrity and alignment to defined governance principles.
 * @context: Trust levels are foundational primitives for AI safety and agent accountability. These definitions will propagate across execution modes and behavioral checks.
