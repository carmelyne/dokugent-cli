# Research Prompt Guidelines

These instructions help ensure LLM-generated research outputs are factual, traceable, and well-structured.

## Objective Framing

- Begin each task with a clear question or hypothesis.
- Define scope: what is in/out of bounds for the output.
- Clarify if summary, synthesis, or exploration is expected.

## Citation and Sources

- Require citations for claims not considered common knowledge.
- Prefer primary or peer-reviewed sources.
- Include inline links or formatted references (see citation-style.md).

## Output Structure

- Use heading-based sections (e.g., Background, Findings, Conclusion).
- Avoid overgeneralization—use hedging when unsure.
- End with a “Sources” or “References” section if applicable.

## Style

- Neutral and professional tone.
- Avoid speculative or emotionally charged language.
- Use plain English even for technical summaries unless academic language is explicitly requested.
