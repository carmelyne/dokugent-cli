# Citation Style Guide

Use this reference to maintain consistency in LLM-generated citations and source references.

## In-text Citations

- Use Markdown-compatible inline format:
  - APA: (Author, Year)
  - MLA: (Author Page)
  - OR: Inline hyperlink: [source](https://...)

## Reference Lists

- Include a “References” or “Sources” section at the end if multiple citations are used.
- Format each entry clearly with author, title, publication, and date.
- When using web sources, always include the full URL.

## General Rules

- Do not invent citations.
- If no source is available, state "source unavailable" or "unverified claim."
- Prefer primary sources when available.
